# Part 4: Optimizing schedules, allocations and plans through multiple programming models with Nerav Doshi

Learn to use tools to develop DO models - There are plenty of tools on the market to develop and solve optimization models, including some open source ones.
IBM offers two ways to start learning DO at no cost: **Decision Optimization for Watson Studio (DO for WS)** and **CPLEX Optimization Studio (COS)**.

## Basic notebook for getting familiar with Decision Optimization 
* [Simple 101 DO notebooks - optimization concepts](https://github.com/lidderupk/ai-developer/tree/master/part4/notebooks)

## LAB for using predictive and prescriptive analytics using Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning
* [Market Campaign use case using only notebooks](https://github.com/nmdoshi/HandsOnLabDOWS/blob/master/DOWS%20and%20WML%20Tutorial.pdf)

## LAB for end to end solution with Data refinery,SPSS and Decision Optimization 
* [Instructions to complete the lab on assigning resources for COVID19](https://github.com/nmdoshi/WatsonStudioPremium-Tutorial-COVID19-Analysis.git)

## Additional material to get familiar with
* [Demo collection for DO in WS](https://www.ibm.com/demos/collection/IBM-Decision-Optimization-for-Watson-Studio/), videos, product tours and hands-on lab from [Nerav Doshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerav-doshi/), Digital Technical Engagement at IBM.
